BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

If you have a copy of the PHC source files, create a symbolic link
named PHCroot pointint to the PHC root directory.  Otherwise, run the
script getPHC.sh to download the source and create the symbolic link.

Install takes two steps at the moment::

python make.py
python setup.py install

WARNING: Requires Cython >= 13.0

HINT: On OS X, if gnat is not in your path, edit the first line of make.py

HINT: If using a recent version of gnat, e.g. gnat 2011, you
need to remove the "-C" flag from LDFLAGS in setup.py
