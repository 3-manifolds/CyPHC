BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

If you have a copy of the PHC source files, create a symbolic link named PHCroot
pointint to the PHC root directory.  Otherwise, run the script getPHC.sh to
download the source and create the symbolic link.

Then run make.

If gnatlink is not in your execution path, you may need to edit the
definition of gnatlink_cmd in setup.py .

If PHC has been updated since this was written you may need to
edit the definition of PHCDIR in getPHC.sh .

Under OS X you may have to edit the path to the libpython dylib file
in setup.py .
